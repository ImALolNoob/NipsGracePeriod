A plugin Created Sir Nipplington's YoloCraft Server Season 3 to allow a grace period for hardcore mode allowing a countdown to run with a bossbar and players that die while the grace period is running will be able to respawn until the time runs out after witch the player will be put into spectator mode.

**Usage**
/timer <start | set | stop> [seconds], Alias /t

This plugin has forced respawn within the grace perid time as hardcore mode shows the "Spectator" mode button upon death screen and sometimes does now allow the user to click the button and are forced to relog may be fixed in the future

This plugin was created in a group effort by **Novato**, **Jacksharkben** and **LaiZBoi**.
