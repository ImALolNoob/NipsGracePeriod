A plugin Created Sir Nipplington's YoloCraft Server Season 3 to allow a grace period for hardcore mode
allowing a countdown to run with a bossbar and players that die while the grace period is running will be
able to respawn until the time runs out after witch the player will be put into spectator mode


this plugin was created in a group effort by Novato, Jacksharkben and LaiZBoi.
